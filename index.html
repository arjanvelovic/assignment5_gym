                    Our lineage is as follows: <span class="text-danger">Carlos Gracie Jr > Alexandre "Soca" Freitas > Fred Villarica/Alonzo Rodriguez</span> Our two 3rd degree Professors Fred and Alonzo are cultivated from one of the Best Lightweights to come from Brazil 6th degree Master Alexandre ‘Soca’ Freitas. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)is a Martial Art that evolved from Judo via Mitsuyo Maeda (Conde Coma) the earliest known pioneer/fighter of today’s Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu out of japan who taught amongst other families in Brazil, the Gracie’s. The Gracie’s have set the way to modern BJJ, being widely known after the Early UFC days with Royce Gracie to a more evolved form of self-defense as well as sport today. What sets Bjj apart from other martial arts is that it can be practiced at full speed against another opponent, no strikes ofcourse, nearly everyday. This is what attracts the normal everyday person to practice Bjj, it can give them a true insight not only in their technique and physical ability but also an insight to themselves, overcoming adversity is a common theme in jiu-jitsu.

                    Increase your strength, conditioning, and mobility while learning an aresenal of offensive moves. Build your confidence! The class starts off with a vigorous warm – up of calisthenics, including jumping jacks, push-ups, sit-ups and running. Once students have broken a sweat and burned some calories, the real fun starts. We have you working with partners doing drills with the focus pads. Focus pads, or “mits” are exactly that – a large mit you wear on each hand that your partner will be throwing various combinations of punches at, as well as blocking your attacks. For students with experience we also include sparring sessions, please bring your gear ie. gloves, mouth piece, shin guards, head gear etc. This class is excellent for developing “hand/eye” coordination as well as conditioning. Want to burn calories? Come in and try a striking class FREE! We know you’ll love it.
